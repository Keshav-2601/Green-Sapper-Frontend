                        <p><strong>Green Building Design:</strong> Our team of expert architects and engineers specialize in designing buildings that are not only aesthetically pleasing but also highly efficient. We focus on incorporating sustainable materials, optimizing natural light, and ensuring superior indoor air quality.</p>
                        <p><strong>Building Energy Simulation:</strong> Using state-of-the-art software tools like TRNSYS and eQUEST we perform detailed energy simulations to predict and enhance the performance of your building. Our simulations help in understanding the energy consumption, thermal comfort, and overall efficiency, enabling us to make data-driven decisions to reduce energy usage and operational costs.</p>
                        <p><strong>Prediction of Buildingâ€™s Future Performance:</strong> Using the machine learning algorithm we also predict the future performance of the building with the changing weather.</p>
